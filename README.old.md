# Introduction
This is the front end portion of my website that is supposed to display information about different breweries across the state of Virginia. I will create 3 different pages home, name, and city to display different information. 

 I will create a fetch request to my local data base, localhost5000, to show that it is working. Then I will use Heroku to host my front and back end. I will then change the url in the fetch request once deployed.

# Setup
1. Create a react App and component pages to display certain data. 

# Sources
API call https://localhost:5000 that will then change to my deployed backend URL

# Project Status
I was able to fetch a request to my localhost:5000 but only with the help of a plugin due to CORs errors that I was not successful in resolving. 

Unfortunately I was unsuccessful in creating a proper map function in order to render certain information from the database that I wanted to render on the two of the three pages.  

I was also unable to deploy my backend.
